# Admin Dashboard (Odin Project)

This is a custom-built **Admin Dashboard** created as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. The design is fully responsive and built using only **HTML and CSS** (no frameworks, no libraries). It focuses on practicing **CSS Grid**, custom layouts, and structured component design.

## 🚀 Features

- Full dashboard layout using **pure CSS Grid**
- Custom fonts including **Norse Bold** and **Roboto** via Google Fonts
- Functional layout components:
  - Top header with search bar, profile, and notification section
  - Welcome banner with user info and action buttons
  - Project grid with cards styled for content and visual hierarchy
  - Announcements and trending panels styled with scrollable content

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic and organized layout structure
- **CSS3** – custom styles using grid, flexbox, and responsive utilities
- **Google Fonts** – Roboto for body text
- **Custom Fonts** – Norse Bold used for headers and branding

## 📌 Notes

> ⚠️ **This is an initial version** of the dashboard.  
> I'm planning to return to this project in the future to:
> - Improve mobile responsiveness
> - Add interactivity with JavaScript
> - Refactor with reusable component structures (e.g. cards, buttons)
> - Possibly transition to a JS framework like React or Vue

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Mastery of **CSS Grid layout techniques**
- Combining `flexbox` and `grid` for layout flexibility
- Structuring a dashboard in a scalable and semantic way
- Importance of consistent spacing, sizing, and alignment
